# Camera_Board

This is embedded project base on the STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller with FreeRTOS and camera OV7725. The microcontroler uses a parallel bus to connect with the image sensor and external RAM. 
  
The image frame from the camera is displayed on the ST7789 display connected by the spi bus. 

In this project, I use other repositories such as:  
https://github.com/armink/CmBacktrace  
https://github.com/to9/embedded-log (not used yet)

The project is still in progress.
