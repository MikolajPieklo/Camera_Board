# Camera_Board

This is embedded project base on the STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller and camera OV7725. The STM32 used a parallel bus to connect with the camera and external RAM.  
  
The image frame from the camera is displayed on the ST7789 display connected by the spi bus. 

In this project, I am using other repositories such as:  
https://github.com/armink/CmBacktrace  
https://github.com/to9/embedded-log (not used yet)

The project is still in progress.
